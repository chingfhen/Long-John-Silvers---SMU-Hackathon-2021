ON VACCINATION-DIFFERENTIATED SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES & ELIGIBILITY Qn: What is vaccination-differentiated Safe Management Measures (SMM) and where is it applicable at? Ans: As fully vaccinated individuals have better protection against infection and severe illness, fully vaccinated individuals may participate in activities in high-risk settings (unmasked activities that take place indoors1 ) from 10 August 2021. The group size can go up to 5 individuals (including instructor / coach). For organised classes/programmes, multiple groups of 5, up to 30 pax or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, is allowed. Unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative result on a Pre-Event Test taken in the past 24 hours at an MOH-approved medical service provider before the expected end of the class/programme/event, or recovered COVID-19 individuals, are of similarly lower risk, and may also join in the group of fully vaccinated individuals. Qn: What does fully vaccinated individual mean? Ans: An individual is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after he or she has received two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty, Moderna, or any WHO EUL vaccines2 . Unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative result on a Pre-Event Test taken in the past 24 hours at an MOH-approved medical service provider before the expected end of the class/programme/event, or recovered COVID-19 individuals, are of similarly lower risk, and may also join in the group of fully vaccinated individuals. Qn: I want to organise unmasked class/programme/activities at my indoor facility. How do I go about it? Ans: Permitted enterprises are: \u2022 to implement vaccination-differentiated SMMs at their indoor facilities \u2022 to prominently display that vaccination-differentiated SMMs are implemented on their premises \u2022 to set up proper checking protocol at their access control \u2022 responsible to conduct checks on the vaccination status of their participants at their access control. Persons who fail to have their status verified will be denied participation in high risk activities. \u2022 to ensure that every person who enter their premises have their vaccination status checked and recorded manually or electronically, beyond the usual screening measures such as TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SE), SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) check-in & check-out and temperature checks. \u2022 to ensure that participants, instructors and staff also adhere to an enhanced set of SMMs per Annex in the Sport Singapore guidance issued on 7 August 2021. 1 Indoors are spaces that are enclosed by shelter and walls where there is inadequate natural ventilation. 2 From 10 August 2021, individuals who are fully vaccinated with the World Health Organisation\u2019s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca will be eligible for the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.

Ans: You can refer to the information at You can also check the status of vaccination or their COVID test records on the participants\u2019 TraceTogether app. For recovered individuals, they can show the pre-event test exemption notice. Operators/organisers should verify that the PET exemption notice belongs to the customer, i.e. NRIC/FIN on the document matches the NRIC/FIN on the customer\u2019s photo ID. Additionally, operators/organisers should verify that the exemption date is valid for the duration of the class/programme. Qn: Can I do a one-time check of vaccination status for regular patrons at my facility instead of checking their trace-together app each time they visit? Ans: Yes. If you are implementing VDS at your facility, you need to: \u2022 Implement Trace Together only SafeEntry or SafeEntry Gateway check-in and check\u0002out and temperature checks (till Aug 19) \u2022 Check the vaccination status of every person who enters your facility FAQs \u2013 Safe Management Measures for Sport and Physical Exercise & Activity Following Mid-Point Review of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) Issued: 7 August 2021 Updated: 13 August 2021 Page 3 of 23 \u2022 Record the vaccination status check manually or electronically o For regular patrons at your facility, you can do a one-time check of their vaccination status and record it in your master list of \u201cpre-verified\u201d fully vaccinated persons. Thereafter, each time these regular patrons visit your gym, you only need to verify they are in your master list of \u201cpre-verified\u201d persons before they are allowed to enter. This of course cannot be done for patrons who come in via PET where you will need to check their PET results every time they visit since it is only valid for 24 hours.

We will provide updates when the details are ready. For such sport competitions and tournaments, spectators are permitted, but must comply with the requirements under Spectator Sport Events above. Unvaccinated children aged 12 and below may be included and exempted from pre-event testing, but must be limited to no more than 20% of total attendance.

Events that were previously endorsed by Sport Singapore will need to have their SMMs updated and organisers are to resubmit their plans using the prescribed form for endorsement by Sport Singapore. Qn: I have previously submitted my application and received Sport Singapore\u2019s endorsement to organise an event. Can I still carry on?

For Children 12 years old and below Children aged 12 years old and below (i.e. born in and after 2009) are currently ineligible for any COVID-19 vaccine under the national vaccination programme. They will be allowed to participate in indoors unmasked classes/programmes/activities, subject to the following provisions: a) Group of not more than 5 participants, where all children aged 12 years and below are of the same household. There can be no multiple groups of 5 participants in an organised class/programme in this situation. b) Participant(s) in the group who are above 12 years can be from a different household as the children, and will have to be fully vaccinated to be part of the group activity. An instructor can lead the group and will be counted in the group of 5. He will need to verify that all children in the group who are 12 years and below are from the same household before the start of the class/programme/activity. Patrons must be prepared to produce proof of any one of the above conditions before entry is allowed. Patrons are strongly encouraged to arrive 15 minutes earlier for the Vaccination\u0002Differentiated SMMs verification process and to avoid delays.
