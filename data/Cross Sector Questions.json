What are the latest measures for tourism businesses? Businesses will resume activities in a phased manner. As Singapore transits towards COVID resilience, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 6 August 2021 that it would ease Safe Management Measures in two steps. The first will take effect from 10 August 2021 and the second from 19 August 2021, if conditions remain stable. Attractions, hotels and tours that had received prior approval to resume, or wish to apply to resume operations, must adhere to the measures set out in the circulars below: Attractions :- Hotels :- Tours :- MICE Event Organisers and venues (collectively, EOs) who wish to submit a joint application and event proposal for STB\u2019s assessment must adhere to the latest Safe Management Measures (SMMs) set out in the circular below: MICE :- If STB is satisfied with the proposal, MTI will give the EO approval to carry out the event. Details on the types of events currently permissible can be found here. For the list of tourism businesses that are permitted to resume, please visit Support for COVID-19 1. What assistance measures are there for businesses? A support package has announced by the Government to help workers and businesses during the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 22 July to 18 August 2021. The package includes the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme for affected sectors, rental relief, support for market and hawker centre stallholders. More information regarding the package and the COVID-19 Recovery Grant-Temporary can be found here. STB has been working closely with the industry to create and pilot new tourism products and experiences to drive domestic demand, and prepare for international recovery. For other measures that have been implemented to help tourism businesses since February 2020, refer to . Tourism businesses should take full advantage of the support provided to stabilise their operations, manage their cash flow, transform their businesses, grow and deepen their manpower capabilities and keep workers employed. The measures that tourism businesses can tap on can be found here. Support will also be given to help businesses and individuals defray third-party professional cleaning and disinfection costs for premises with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Full details here. The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act seeks to provide temporary relief to those who are unable to perform their contractual obligations because of COVID-19 and the resulting safe distancing measures. For the full list of specific contracts covered under this Bill, or for more information, please refer to the Ministry of Law\u2019s website or STB\u2019s website. The Ministry of Health has also set up the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA) Scheme to mitigate financial impact for those who have been served Quarantine Orders. Under the scheme, claims of $100 per day can be made by two groups: Self-employed; and Employers, who have employees issued with Quarantine Orders Please refer to the Ministry of Health\u2019s website for more details on the QOA scheme. 2. How will the extension on the Job Support Scheme (JSS) be useful to businesses in the tourism sector? JSS provides wage support for employers to retain their local employees during this period of economic uncertainty. All active employers, with the exception of Government organisations (local and foreign) and representative offices, are eligible for the JSS. Under the COVID-19 Resilience Package, the scheme will be further extended and provide continued support for businesses and workers by covering wages paid from April to June 2021. The JSS support levels will be tapered based on the projected recovery of the various sectors. For more information, please refer to Travel Restrictions and Precautionary Measures 1.

Singapore has introduced the Air Travel Pass, Air Travel Bubble [1], Reciprocal Green/Fast Lanes and Connect@Singapore initiative [2] to facilitate short-term visits into Singapore, and is piloting the Business Travel Pass.

[2] The Connect@Singapore initiative is currently suspended until further notice. Protecting our staff and visitors 1. What precautions should we adopt to ensure safe distancing? Businesses must ensure that their establishments, staff and customers comply with all necessary safe management measures (SMMs) that apply to them. For more information, visit For more information on tourism-related SMMs please visit: Attractions :- Hotels and Hostels :- Tours :- Retail establishments :- F&B establishments :- MICE :- Businesses should also refer to to continue to ensure safe workplaces. Strict checks will be conducted, and businesses that do not provide a safe workplace for our workers will have their operations suspended until they are able to do so. Companies may wish to adopt additional recommended SMMs, on top of existing workplace SMMs, to better safeguard the health of their employees and customers. This includes: Placing employees working in higher-risk settings on regular tests using fast and easy tests (FETs) such as the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) [1] Proactively managing potential contacts of COVID-19 cases at the workplace Avoiding workplace gatherings Enforcing mask discipline for all employees and patrons [2] Ventilating the workplace and maximising fresh air intake where possible [3] Encouraging workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible As part of the suite of measures to reduce transmission for mask-off activities as we resume more activities [4], all staff who work at settings with unmasked clients/patrons will be required to be placed on a FET regime, using tests such as ART, regardless of their vaccination status. These include staff of: Dine-in F&B establishments (starting progressively) Personal care and appearance services that require removal of masks (e.g. facial services, saunas, make-up services) Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked Businesses and organisations are reminded to play their part to keep Singapore safe. Should they be unable to meet the safe management principles, businesses and organisations can engage the relevant agencies to seek approval for alternative safe distancing measures. Such businesses and activities should only open when they are ready. Businesses and organisations found to be flouting safe management principles may be required to close. [1] Please visit HSA\u2019s website for the list of COVID-19 antigen rapid tests (ART) self-test kits authorised for use in Singapore: [2] For more information on masks, you may refer to Health Science Authority\u2019s (HSA) article entitled \u201cWhat you need to know about Masks\u201d [3] Please refer to the guidance note for detailed technical recommendations for premises according to the type of ventilation systems used [4] 3. What do we do if a customer is a suspected case? Please refer your customers to the nearest General Practitioner (GP) for medical treatment. The GP will refer patients who meet the case definition for COVID-19 to the hospital via a dedicated ambulance for further assessment. Business Costs 1. How do we handle requests for refunds from affected customers? Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, businesses and individuals who are unable to perform their contractual obligations due on or after 1 February 2020 because of COVID-19, will be given time to work out a solution with the other party without the threat or uncertainty of litigation or legal proceedings. This provides temporary relief from legal action for up to six months. To claim relief, one party to a contract should serve a notification for relief on the other party. However, it does not mean that obligations are postponed or are absolved. Parties may still be charged interest or penalties if they delay in performance or fail to perform. This Bill applies to specific contracts entered into or renewed before 25 March 2020.
